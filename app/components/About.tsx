            Hi, I&apos;m Mike Klein, a Senior Software Engineer with over a
            decade of experience in developing innovative solutions across
            various industries. My journey has taken me from the U.S. Coast
            Guard to the tech world, where I&apos;ve led teams, architected
            complex systems, and delivered high-impact projects.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-6">
            I specialize in full-stack development, with expertise in
            JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Python, and cloud
            technologies. My experience spans from startups to government
            agencies, giving me a unique perspective on solving diverse
            technological challenges.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            When I&apos;m not coding, I love spending time with my wife and
            daughter, especially going on vacations together. I&apos;m also an
            avid reader of science fiction and fantasy, enjoy fishing, and like
            to unwind with video games. I believe in maintaining a healthy
            work-life balance and continuously learning both in my professional
            and personal life.
